# Retrieving GEOData

# Download the code from http://www.pythonlearn.com/code/geodata.zip - then unzip 
# the file and edit where.data to add an address nearby where you live - don't reveal 
# your actual location. Then run the geoload.py to lookup all of the entries in where.data 
# (including the new one) and produce the geodata.sqlite. Then run geodump.py to read the 
# database and produce where.js. Then open where.html to visualize the map. Take screen 
# shots as described below.

# This is a relatively simple assignment. Don't take off points for little mistakes. 
# If they seem to have done the assignment give them full credit. Feel free to make suggestions 
# if there are small mistakes. Please keep your comments positive and useful. If you do not 
# take grading seriously, the instructors may delete your response and you will lose points.
