# Counting Organizations (Single table SQL)

# This application will read the mailbox data (mbox.txt) count up the 
# number email messages per organization (i.e. domain name of the email 
# address) using a database with the following schema to maintain the counts.
# CREATE TABLE Counts (org TEXT, count INTEGER)

# When you have run the program on mbox.txt upload the resulting database 
# file above for grading.
# If you run the program multiple times in testing or with dfferent files, 
# make sure to empty out the data before each run.

# You can use this code as a starting point for your application: 
# http://www.pythonlearn.com/code/emaildb.py.

# The data file for this application is the same as in previous assignments: 
# http://www.pythonlearn.com/code/mbox.txt.

# Because the sample code is using an UPDATE statement and committing the results 
# to the database as each record is read in the loop, it might take as long as a 
# few minutes to process all the data. The commit insists on completely writing 
# all the data to disk every time it is called.

# The program can be speeded up greatly by moving the commit operation outside of 
# the loop. In any database program, there is a balance between the number of 
# operations you execute between commits and the importance of not losing the 
# results of operations that have not yet been committed.
